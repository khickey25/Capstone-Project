    "Here is the outline of steps to be performed in this notebook. There will be two seperate pipelines: one for the numeric data, and one for categorical data. First we will format the data by fixing data format issues before building both pipelines, as explained below. Then we will apply the two seperate pipelines to the two seperate data types, numeric and categorical, and combine both seperate pipelines into one combined pipeline. This pipeline will output the transformed data, that will then be used with whichever modeling technique, to ensure that the data is the same between all model comparisons.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Format the target classes, format the 'pitch_name' classes, and drop 'player_name' feature.\n",
    "    - There are three classes in the target: \"blocked_ball\", \"ball\", \"called_strike\". Since a blocked ball is the same thing as a ball, we will group those two classes into one class, \"ball\"\n",
    "    - There are only a handful amounts of class \"Eephus\", (almost all pitchers do not regularly throw this pitch) in 'pitch_name', so we can drop those rows which have this class. The class \"knuckle curve\" is essentialy the same thing as \"curveball\". Therefore, we will group these two into the same class, \"curveball\".\n",
    "    - 'Player_name' is not needed for modeling results, as its simply an identifying featre. So we can disregard it for modeling purposes, but will keep it for future tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the two seperate pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. #### Numeric Data Pipeline: \n",
    "    - Impute any missing values using median imputation\n",
    "    - Scale data using scikit-learn's StandardScaler() class\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. #### Categorical Data (will only be pitch_name feature):\n",
    "    - Impute any missing values using \n",
    "    - One-hot encode to create dummy variables for classes of particular feature\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. #### Combine both pipelines together using scikit-learn ColumnTransformer class.\n",
