    "The Pipeline will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the data in with custom function built at the end of the `Baseball_EDA` notebook.\n",
    "2. Build a Pipeline object with two components: a random undersampler and the classification model. Random Undersampler was chosen due to imbalance of the target classes. \n",
    "3. Fit the pipeline to training data and verify results using 5-fold cross validation. This process will use custom function in the `Evaluation.py` module. \n",
    "4. View the coefficient values of the Logistic Regression and analize its results. \n",
    "5. Apply the pipeline to testing data to get test results that will be compared with other models. "

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the coefficient values, it apppers that a fastball and its derivatives, a 2-seam fastball and a sinker, have a positive affect on determining a ball or a strike. Off speed pitches, like a Changeup, seem to have the opposite affect. Thus, one 'rule' that is inferable from the results is that throwing a fastball increases the chances of throwing a strike, while throwing an off speed decreases the liklihood of a strike. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, just the type of pitch alone is not very useful in determining a strike or ball.  Looking at the other features, the release position of the pitch in the z dimension also seems to show that increasing the value of this feature leads to a higher chance of prediction for a strike. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the thresholds of the strike zone are another important set of features. The basic intuition is that, for an individual pitch, an increase in the top of the zone threshold value increases the chances of that pitch being a strike, noted by the positive coefficient value. The opposite effect is seen at the bottom of the zone threshold; if that value increases, the liklihood of that pitch being called a strike decreases. This makes sense: a taller batter will have a larger zone, which gives the pitcher more area to work with, and a higher threshold for the bottom of the zone means that the strike zone shrinks, and pitches near bottom of the zone for other hitters are less likely to be called a strike for hitters with a higher threshold.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This, however, also assumes that the values of the other pitches are held constant. In delivering a baseball pitch, that assumption simply does not hold; the process is too complex to be able to constantly provide the same values of velocity and movement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, some human subjective rules that we can infer is that fastball and related pitches thrown with a higher level trajectory may have a higher chance of being called a strike. However, the usefullness of such rules is questionable.   "
